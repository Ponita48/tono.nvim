# TONO (JSON to Native Object)

Convert your JSON to your Language Native Object.

This plugin uses [Jinja2](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/) as a templating library, which means you can create your own template that fits your workflow.

## Installation

Before installing this plugin, make sure you have `python3` and `Jinja2` installed.

In order to use this plugin, put this into your package manager.

### [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim)
```lua
{
  "Ponita48/tono.nvim",
  dependencies = { "nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim" },
  config = function()
    require("tono.generator").setup()
  end
}
```

## Usage

To use this plugin, use the command below inside your neovim.

```lua
:TonoFiles
```

### Custom Directory

This plugin also support custom directory, which means you can adjust your template based on your own requirement.

To add a custom directory, use this setup on your plugin setup

### [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim)
```lua
{
  "Ponita48/tono.nvim",
  dependencies = { "nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim" },
  config = true,
  opts = {
    additional_dir = "/my/custom/directory",
  }
